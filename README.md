# AIO Dev Tools
Bug Finder, Transaction Explainer, Solidity Playground, and Chain Health Monitor.

---

## ✨ Overview
AIO Dev Tools is a lightweight developer toolkit designed for Base Sepolia.  
It combines several utilities in a single Farcaster mini-app:

- 🐞 **Bug Finder** – report, track, and discuss contract issues.  
- 🔍 **TX Explainer** – decode and visualize transaction data.  
- 🛠️ **Solidity Playground** – write, compile, and deploy contracts to Base Sepolia.  
- 📊 **Chain Health** – display stats about block height, gas usage, and network status.

All smart contracts run on **Base Sepolia**, while metadata such as bug reports is stored in **database**
